      <h1><a href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a></h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a> is a Rails plugin that
tries to make image uploading and rendering super easy.
</p>
<p>
There are 2 pieces involved in making Rails image handling easy.
</p>
<h3>1. Image Uploads</h3>
<p>
In this post Rails 2, resource-driven world, <a
href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a> believes that images should
belong directly to a record. So you simply tell your model class to act as
<a href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a>, and your model
effortlessly gains the ability to handle file uploads.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your model gains the ability to interface directly with a
<tt>file_field</tt> form, allowing uploads with zero extra controller or
model code.

</li>
<li>Accept uploads from a web address, pulling in the image from the internet
and saving it locally.

</li>
<li>Image presence validation with customizable form field error messages.

</li>
<li>Image format validation that will not allow the file to be uploaded unless
RMagick can parse it into useable image data.

</li>
<li>Image pre-processing to keep uploaded images under a certain size, or other
on-upload image processing tasks.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Image Rendering</h3>
<p>
The other half of the problem comes from the need to send the uploaded
images back to the web browser. Most of the time, you need to display the
image in different sizes or formats in different places on your site. For
example, a product image in a store may need a square thumbnail image, a
medium image for its focus page, and a large image for an &quot;enlarge
this photo&quot; popup.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a> uses a simple templating
engine that allows you to re-render images exactly how you need them. Using
the same &quot;master image,&quot; many images can be rendered from the
same source. You can even go beyond resizing; there is support for image
overlays, text drawing, drop shadows, borders and more. The rendering
engine is flexible and extensible to whatever your dynamic image needs are.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Renderer implemented as template engine, which fits in perfectly with Rails
2 RESTful style format-sensitive views.

</li>
<li>Does not need to have everything resized on upload allowing your site
layout the change later on, and all images will re-render themselves just
right with your new rendering templates.

</li>
<li>Support for special effects like text, image or logo overlays, borders and
shadows.

</li>
<li>Extensible by adding image operator classes which allow for reusable
snippets of direct RMagick code.

</li>
<li>Requires absolutely zero controller code.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>1. Installing the plugin</h2>
<p>
If running on rails edge:
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/Squeegy/fleximage.git
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you have to do a manual install since Rails does not yet support
git. Download this file:
</p>
<p>
<a
href="http://github.com/Squeegy/fleximage/tarball/master">github.com/Squeegy/fleximage/tarball/master</a>
</p>
<p>
Unzip, and place the root <tt>fleximage</tt> folder in your
<tt>railsapproot/vendor/plugins</tt> directory.
</p>
<h2>2. Activating your model</h2>
<p>
You need to let your model know it should be <a
href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a>-friendly. Lets say you have
a model for photos.
</p>
<pre>
  # app/models/photo.rb
  class Photo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_fleximage :image_directory =&gt; 'public/images/uploaded_photos'
  end
</pre>
<p>
The :<tt>image_directory</tt> option tells the plugin where to store your
master images. This value is relative to your application root, and
doesn&#8216;t need to be in your public directory if you don&#8216;t want
it to be. This is where the source images will be that all your templates
start with.
</p>
<p>
There are many other options for your model. Refer to the <tt><a
href="../classes/Fleximage/Model/ClassMethods.html">Fleximage::Model::ClassMethods</a></tt>
class in the <tt>rdoc</tt> for more information on these.
</p>
<h2>3. The upload form</h2>
<p>
Your users need a way to upload their images into your site. Here is how we
might render a form to create a photo record.
</p>
<pre>
  # app/views/photos/new.html.erb

  &lt;% form_for @photo, :html =&gt; { :multipart =&gt; true } do |f| %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;%= f.text_field :author %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Upload Image&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;%= f.file_field :image_file %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      or URL: &lt;%= f.text_field :image_file_url %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;%= f.submit &quot;Create&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: The &quot;:html =&gt; { :multipart =&gt; true }&quot; is
<b>VERY</b> <b>IMPORTANT</b>. Without this snippet your browser will not
send binary data to the server. If things aren&#8216;t working, check to
make sure you have this in your form declaration.
</p>
<p>
The relevant bit of our form code is:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Upload Image&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;%= f.file_field :image_file %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    or URL: &lt;%= f.text_field :image_file_url %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>
First there is a file upload field, mapping the the &quot;image_file&quot;
attribute of our model. When the user browses to a local file and uploads
it, the model is waiting to accept an uploaded file on this attribute and
will automatically open it and save it to disk for you.
</p>
<p>
Right along side the upload field is a simple text field, which maps to the
&quot;image_file_url&quot; property. Your model also listens for assignment
to this attribute to automatically fetch the contents of a URL and save it
locally as the master image.
</p>
<p>
You can have just one of these fields, or both. The model will know how to
do the right thing either way.
</p>
<p>
When the user submits the form, all you have to do is assign the form
contents to your object in standard Rails fashion, and the image is
uploaded and saved for you. Creating a new photo may look like this in your
controller:
</p>
<pre>
  # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb
  def create
    @photo = Photo.new(params[:photo])
    if @photo.save
      redirect_to photo_url(@photo)
    else
      flash[:notice] = 'Your photo did not pass validation!'
      render :action =&gt; 'new'
    end
  end
</pre>
<h2>4. Linking to the generated images</h2>
<p>
Rails 2 has amazing support for format driven responses. Given a photo
object, by default it would have an HTML view that describes information
about that photo. With <a href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a>,
the JPG or (GIF or PNG) view can be the image data itself.
</p>
<p>
A photo HTML view may look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  # app/views/photos/show.html.erb
  # http://mysite.com/photos/123

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= image_tag formatted_photo_path(@photo, :jpg) %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Name:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;%=h @photo.name %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Author:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;%=h @photo.author %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>
That image tag uses a Rails route as its <tt>src</tt>. In this case, that
route corresponds to the <tt>.jpg</tt> format of the <tt>photo</tt>
resource, which would give us a URL like:
</p>
<pre>
  http://mysite.com/photos/123.jpg
</pre>
<p>
This is the URL where the image will be.
</p>
<h2>5. Rendering the image</h2>
<p>
Now it&#8216;s time to actually create a template to render the image. This
happens through a special view with a .<tt>flexi</tt> extension. This view
template will pull out the master image for you, and send it to the browser
as binary data after your processing of it done.
</p>
<p>
The filename of the template should look like this:
<tt>action_name.jpg.flexi</tt>, where <tt>action_name</tt> is the
controller action that will render this view. The <tt>jpg</tt> tells the
controller to render this view when the <tt>jpg</tt> format is asked for.
The <tt>flexi</tt> tells Rails to render this view with the <a
href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a> template engine, rather than
<tt>erb</tt>, <tt>builder</tt> or other template types.
</p>
<p>
The syntax of the view is pure ruby, but to process the image the view
needs to call <tt>operate</tt> on the instance of your model.
</p>
<p>
Here is the view to render a photo record at 320x240:
</p>
<pre>
  # app/views/photos/show.jpg.flexi
  # http://mysite.com/photos/123.jpg
  @photo.operate do |image|
    image.resize '320x240'
  end
</pre>
<p>
Calling <tt>@photo.operate { |image| .. }</tt> prepares the model object
for image processing and provides a ruby object that will allow you to
perform image transformations. This example just resizes the image to
320x240, however many other operators are included.
</p>
<p>
Here is a .<tt>flexi</tt> template that will do much more:
</p>
<pre>
  # app/views/show.jpg.flexi
  @photo.operate do |image|
    image.resize '640x480', :crop =&gt; true
    image.image_overlay 'public/images/logo.png',
      :alignment =&gt; :bottom_right,
      :offset =&gt; '20x20'
    image.border :size =&gt; 10, :color =&gt; 'green'
    image.text 'I like Cheese'
    image.unsharp_mask
    image.shadow
  end
</pre>
<p>
This template will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Resize the image to exactly 640x480, cropping off any extra.

</li>
<li>Add a logo 20 pixels form the lower right corner

</li>
<li>Add a green 10 pixel border

</li>
<li>Write &quot;I like Cheese&quot; in the upper left corder

</li>
<li>Sharpen the image

</li>
<li>Add a black drop shadow on a white background

</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h1>Other Useful Information</h1>
<h2>Image output format</h2>
<p>
You don&#8216;t want to render JPGs? That&#8216;s fine. Just link to the
format you want (:<tt>jpg</tt>, :<tt>gif</tt> or :<tt>png</tt>) and declare
the your template name to match and the image will be rendered properly.
For instance, this will render a <tt>gif</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
  # app/views/photos/show.html.erb
  &lt;%= image_tag photo_path(@photo, :gif) %&gt;

  # app/views/photos/show.gif.flexi
  @photo.operate do |image|
    @photo.resize '150x150', :crop =&gt; true
  end
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a> template engine will
automatically detect the format that is being asked for, and render the
right type of image.
</p>
<h2>Converting/Upgrading your master image store</h2>
<p>
Are you upgrading your live app to the new file store creation date based
format? Did you start out with PNG image storage, and later realize you
need to store with the more space economic JPG instead? Not problem, <a
href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a> provides some rake tasks to
help you out.
</p>
<p>
Each conversion rake task requires that you tell it the class for which
that you are changing the file store. For example, if you want to change to
the new creation date based storage structure, for the class
<tt>Photo</tt>, you can run a rake task like this:
</p>
<pre>
  rake fleximage:convert:to_nested FLEXIMAGE_CLASS=Photo
</pre>
<p>
Or if you want to run this on your production database
</p>
<pre>
  rake fleximage:convert:to_nested FLEXIMAGE_CLASS=Photo RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: These tasks manipulate the source files that make up your
images. I take no responsibility if these rake tasks delete all your
images. <b>It is highly advised you back up you master image directory
before running any of these tasks on your production site.</b>
</p>
<p>
Here are all the conversion tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fleximage:convert:to_nested : Converts your master image store from the
flat based path/to/images/123.png format to the creation date based format
path/to/images/2008/11/12/123.png based format. Use this task if you are
upgrading from an older version of <a
href="../classes/Fleximage.html">Fleximage</a>.

</li>
<li>fleximage:convert:to_flat : Converts your master image store from the
creation date based path/to/images/2008/11/12/123.png format to the flat
format path/to/images/123.png format. Note this will leave the date based
directories in place, but they will be empty and can be easily manually
deleted.

</li>
<li>fleximage:convert:to_jpg : Converts all your stored master images from PNG
format to JPG format. This will compress your previously lossless master
images.

</li>
<li>fleximage:convert:to_png : Converts all your stored master images from JPG
format to PNG format.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
After you run any of these tasks, make sure to update your model&#8216;s
class accessors <tt>use_creation_date_based_directories</tt> and
<tt>image_storage_format</tt> to reflect the state of your image store.
Otherwise, the plugin will not find you master images for rendering.
