= Pikizi
An interactive Quiz sale advisor fed by a mash-up of all products's reviews available on the internet.

== the pikizi server (this doc @ http://wikismo.com/doc/app/index.html)
it fullfills 2 needs
* manage a set of Category, Product, Feature, Question, Review, Recommendation, etc..., also named "wiki-product", "knowledge base", "datamodel"
* populate the wiki-product with data extracted from reviews of products

== the df_engine server (see http://engine.wikismo.com/doc/app/index.html)
provides an interactive Quiz (a sequence of Question) to Voter. The sequence of question is computed in real time on a per Voter basis, using data mining algorithms

= Process
1. describe a Category of Product with a collection of Feature and FeatureValue
2. create Review objects related to Product either through crowd sourcing users/bloggers and/or robots
3. the ReviewsParser takes Review objects and generate  FeatureReview objects (and eventually new/updated Feature, FeatureValue objects)
4. review and supervise the ReviewsParser results
5. detect statistical correlation among Choice / values (business user == push email + good keyboard)
6. the QuestionsGenerator produces Question, Choice and Recommendation objects
7. user create questions (QuestionTip, QuestionPoll or QuestionFeature) or update/complete the previously generated questions
8. the QuizEngineProxy updates the pikizi_engine with updated Question, Choice, Product, Recommendation, etc... and retrieves all "data mined", like cluster of Voter, ranking of Question, correlation among questions, etc...
